The planner wants you to analyze the current power plant options and tell them which power plants to retire, which to keep, and which new power plants to bring online. The goal is to find the right mix of plants across the entire generator fleet that will meet demand at the least cost while also achieving our emissions goal.\n",

    "  - We need to be able to meet demand at all hours in all four seasons.\n",
    "- If a firm does not make a positive profit, they will not want to stay in the market. Therefore, we will assume that if any plant you have chosen makes negative profits, that plant will receive capacity payments to bring them up to zero profit so they will stay in the market. This capacity payment will be added to the overall costs of the sceneario you choose.\n",

    "You can use the seasonal supply profiles below to help determine which plant types you might need to meet demand at least cost while remaining within your emissions budget. The plots below show the maximum capacity for wind and solar at different hours of the day for a 100MW plant. For example, a 100MW solar plant can run at nearly the full 100MW capacity at 12pm during summer, but can only generate about 80MW at 12pm in fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In this simulation, all other plant types besides wind and solar can run at full capacity in any hour. In reality, hydroelectric generators may have other non-electric constraints related to rainfall and water usuage."
